# DrawingNet
DoodleNet is an drawing database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of doodles. Currently we have an average of one or zero doodle per node. We hope DoodleNet will become a useful resource for researchers, educators, students and all of you who share our passion for drawing.
